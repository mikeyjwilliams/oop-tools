# MySQL Tools Builder File

The given file will incrementally build the database piece by piece by you running the commands.

1. **Before Running** you need to go into mysql and create your own _Database_ to use though.
    1. if you are using XAMPP, or WAMPSERVER go to PhpAdmin.
    1. if you are using a Linux flavor you can go into the terminal
    if MySQL is already installed and 'CREATE DATABASE {database name}'.
    then use MySQL workbench, datagrip - jetbrains, visual studio(possibly?) or something else for the rest.
 
1. _choose_ said database next. 'USE {database name}'; 
1. you can run(paste) the CREATE TAble(s) individually or together.
1. **BUT** the _INSERTS_ you need to run(paste) individually or an error can occur during 'INSERT INTO Tools' and 'INSERT INTO 'Images'.

## If You Like

This is just a project I am playing with as a hobby and sharing for others to play with in PHP and MySQL. The data is all there in the 'CREATE TABLE(s)' for you to try a different approach if you think you have a better solution, or to try your hand at Creating a multi-table database. Best of Luck.
